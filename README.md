## Project Overview
The DevOps Backend API provides a RESTful interface for managing various resources in a web application. It includes endpoints for user management, FAQ handling, contact form submissions, feature listings, and reviews. The API is secured with JWT authentication, requiring an access token for most endpoints.

This project is ideal for developers looking to integrate a backend API into their web or mobile applications, with support for authentication, CRUD operations, and Docker-based deployment.
